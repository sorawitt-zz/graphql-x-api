The apartment will be furnished with a queen-sized bed, a desk , a sofa, flat-screen television, and internet / Netflix. Located north of Little Italy, Nolita was originally considered part of Little Italy but has gradually lost most of its recognizable Italian character. As trendy restaurants, bars and boutiques popped up in Nolita’s winding streets, the area started developing a separate identity from the surrounding neighborhoods. Similar to SoHo, Nolita is known for its architecture and “hip” reputation. However, Nolita lacks the high density of tourists that flock to its neighbors, allowing for a more local feel. Known for its fashionable retail, young residents and expensive apartments, Nolita is slowly splitting from its association with SoHo and Little Italy, maturing into a full-fledged neighborhood.
